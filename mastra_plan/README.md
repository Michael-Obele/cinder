# Mastra MCP Integration Plan

This directory contains the plan and documentation for building a Mastra MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that integrates with the Cinder project.

## Goal

The goal is to expose Cinder's capabilities (Search, Scrape, Crawl) as MCP tools, allowing AI agents (like Claude, Cursor, etc.) to utilize Cinder's powerful scraping and searching features.

## Contents

- [Architecture](./architecture.md): High-level architecture of the integration.
- [Tools Specification](./tools.md): Detailed definition of the MCP tools to be implemented.
- [Implementation Guide](./implementation.md): Step-by-step guide to building the Mastra app.
- [Setup](./setup.md): Instructions for setting up the development environment.

## Next Steps

Follow the [Implementation Guide](./implementation.md) to start building the Mastra MCP server.
